# Machine-learning-for-project-portfolios

## Purpose
Apply machine learning to understand how to improve the project portfolio

## Introduction

There is a full description [here](https://lawrencerowland.github.io/2020/05/05/Applying-Machine-Learning-at-different-levels.html), suggesting different ways of approaching the topic. 

## Or straight to code and examples
If you want to go straight to code, then here are the folder choices:

1. [Project success Prediction](https://github.com/lawrencerowland/Machine-learning-for-project-portfolios/tree/master/project%20success%20prediction)

1. [Natural language processing for assessing your project domain using Orange](https://github.com/lawrencerowland/Data-Model-for-Project-Frameworks/tree/master/Project%20frameworks%20by%20using%20NLP%20in%20Orange%20Datamining)

1. [Natural language processing for assessing your project domain using Gensim and other Python libraries](https://github.com/lawrencerowland/Data-Model-for-Project-Frameworks/tree/master/Project%20frameworks%20by%20using%20NLP%20with%20Python%20libraries)

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
Taking portfolio data and applying ML for insight. 

Currently the approaches are conventional ML applied to project data from spreadsheets and relational databases. For ML applied to project data taken from graph databases,see (here)[https://lawrencerowland.github.io/2020/05/05/Applying-Machine-Learning-at-different-levels.html]
