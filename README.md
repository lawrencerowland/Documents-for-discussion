# Machine-learning-for-project-portfolios

## Purpose
Apply machine learning to understand how to improve the project portfolio

## Introduction

There is a full description [here](https://lawrencerowland.github.io/2020/05/05/Applying-Machine-Learning-at-different-levels.html), suggesting different ways of approaching the topic. 

### Or straight to code and examples
If you want to go straight to code, then here are the folder choices:

1. [Project success Prediction](https://github.com/lawrencerowland/Machine-learning-for-project-portfolios/tree/master/project%20success%20prediction)

1. [Natural language processing for assessing your project domain using Orange](https://github.com/lawrencerowland/Data-Model-for-Project-Frameworks/tree/master/Project%20frameworks%20by%20using%20NLP%20in%20Orange%20Datamining)

1. [Natural language processing for assessing your project domain using Gensim and other Python libraries](https://github.com/lawrencerowland/Data-Model-for-Project-Frameworks/tree/master/Project%20frameworks%20by%20using%20NLP%20with%20Python%20libraries)


## Use cases for machine learning in managing projects. 

Below shows the phase of project delivery and Operations these use cases first appear.

## Summary of start-up steps for application

Once a use-case has been chosen, the following decisions can be made:

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol><li>Identify possible use cases</li><li> Map  to business area/lifecycle</li><li>Narrow down to a generic ML method</li><li>Select a straightforward ML model</li><li>Choose a suitable model environment</li><li>Choose a code library or algorithm to apply that model</li><li>Select data-set</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->
More is said about each stage below::

## Selection of machine-learning method 
Use cases will be better suited to one type of ML method or another.

## Selection of machine-learning model
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To apply this type of ML method, one may wish to use one of the following specific model types as a first pass. </p>

## Selection of model environment
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here are some accessible environments where one can apply these types of ML methods. </p>

## Selection of machine-learning code library
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here are some examples of libraries where you can find these models in a way you can apply:</p>

<p>Machine learning boosts most stages of the project lifecycle, from Project definition to close-out </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This gives something to play with, and get something to work. There are plenty of ML prototyping frameworks available to provide structure for developing a prototype. <a href="https://predictionmachines.ai">Agrawal et al </a> have a canvas for planning it at high level, understanding purpose and constraints. </p>

Taking portfolio data and applying ML for insight. 
The examples given so far are all low-code approaches so that portfolio managers can apply approaches themselves. 
I will add some of the approaches requiring code once tidied up.

Currently the approaches are conventional ML applied to project data from spreadsheets and relational databases. For ML applied to project data taken from graph databases,see (here)[https://github.com/lawrencerowland/Machine-learning-for-project-portfolios/wiki/Machine-learning-via-graph-databases-for-portfolios-projects-and-programmes]
